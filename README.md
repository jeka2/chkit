# Chickit
An ever-evolving reddit clone built with React and Ruby On Rails. Currently, the app offers the ability to search and rate posts.

## Motivation
Wanting to test my newly-discovered knowledge of the React framework, a reddit clone seemed like a great challange. The structure is almost begging to make a component out of everything.

## Technologies
The project uses React, Ruby on Rails, Redux Middleware, thunk middleware, and several React Dom and Router features.

## Challenges
Considering this was my first React-based project, I was in store for many new concepts in both JavaScript as well as React and its toolkit. As I began development, something curious hit me in terms of data transfer between the front end and the back end, and I decided to implement a key authentication system. That took a bit of figuring out as well.

## Learning Outcomes
Through developing the app, the concepts pertaining to the component and state flow in a react application became more and more clear. The propagation of Redux state objects into the props of a component, thunk functions, and the general flow of a fullstack application were understood to a better degree.

## Usage
The project contains a front-end folder as well as a back-end folder. To run the react client, type 'nmp start' inside the front-end folder. To run the Rails back-end server, type 'rails server' or 'rails s'. The client runs on port 3000 and the server on port 3001.
